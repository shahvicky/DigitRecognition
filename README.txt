The code is collectively build on google colab and the projectmnist.py file is generated from it.

The code can run on any editor(spyder), as the code has no dependency.

Project uses library as follows:
1)Pandas - To load dataset
2)matplotlib - For plotting graphs of accuracy, loss and ROC.
3)numpy - For reshaping of training data and kaggle output for online submission
4)keras - The CNN model is implemented using keras.
5)sklearn - Sklearn is used for preprocessing and for computation of confusion_matrix.

The code would need installation of keras library. 

GitHub link has been used to fetch the training and testing data and so will work universally.

The current working code has 15 epochs and takes around 30 mins on laptop to run. To make it work fast decrease the number of epochs to 4 or 5 but will also decrease the accuracy. 

The code on google colab has runtime no more than 5 mins

We have also submitted the predicted output of kaggle non labelled test dataset on its website. The same is being printed in console.
